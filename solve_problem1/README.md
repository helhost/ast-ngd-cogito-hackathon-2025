# Steps to solve problem 1

1. Run the `cropping.ipynb` file to crop the imaages to just the bounding box
2. Run the `train_test_split.ipynb` file to split croppped images into 2 datasets
3. Run the `altercations_split.ipynb` file to generate more images of the categories there are few images for
4. Run the `efficientNet.ipynb` file to generate the prediction model, and label encoder
